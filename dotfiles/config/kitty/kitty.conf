# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value
# yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to

# monitor with a high refresh rate.

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents

#
# You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut that is
# assigned in the default configuration.
#
# You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single shortcut, using the
# syntax below:
# map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...
# For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e combine : new_window : next_layout
# this will create a new window and switch to the next available layout

# Clipboard
map ctrl+shift+v        paste_from_clipboard
map ctrl+shift+s        paste_from_selection
map ctrl+shift+c        copy_to_clipboard
map shift+insert        paste_from_selection
# You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any program using
# pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's open program is used, but
# you can specify your own, for example:
# map ctrl+shift+o      pass_selection_to_program firefox
map ctrl+shift+o        pass_selection_to_program

# Scrolling
map ctrl+shift+up        scroll_line_up
map ctrl+shift+down      scroll_line_down
map ctrl+shift+k         scroll_line_up
map ctrl+shift+j         scroll_line_down
map ctrl+shift+page_up   scroll_page_up
map ctrl+shift+page_down scroll_page_down
map ctrl+shift+home      scroll_home
map ctrl+shift+end       scroll_end

# You can open a new window running an arbitrary program, for example:
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window mutt
#
# You can pass the current selection to the new program by using the @selection placeholder
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window less @selection
#
# You can even send the contents of the current screen + history buffer as stdin using
# the placeholders @text (which is the plain text) and @ansi (which includes text styling escape codes).
# For only the current screen, use @screen or @ansi_screen.
# For example, the following command opens the scrollback buffer in less in a new window.
# map ctrl+shift+y      new_window @ansi less +G -R
#
# You can open a new window with the current working directory set to the
# working directory of the current window using
# map ctrl+alt+enter    new_window_with_cwd


# Tab management
map ctrl+shift+right    next_tab
map ctrl+shift+left     previous_tab
map ctrl+shift+t        new_tab
map ctrl+shift+q        close_tab
map ctrl+shift+l        next_layout
map ctrl+shift+.        move_tab_forward
map ctrl+shift+,        move_tab_backward
# You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being the first tab
# map ctrl+alt+1          goto_tab 1
# map ctrl+alt+2          goto_tab 2

# Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of arbitrary
# commands to run when using new_tab and use new_tab_with_cwd.


# Miscellaneous
map ctrl+shift+equal    increase_font_size
map ctrl+shift+minus    decrease_font_size
map ctrl+shift+backspace restore_font_size
map ctrl+shift+f11      toggle_fullscreen
map ctrl+shift+u        input_unicode_character
# Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used ot open the URL is specified in open_url_with.
# You can customize how the URLs are detected and opened by specifying command line options to
# url_hints. For example:
# map ctrl+shift+e        run_simple_kitten text url_hints --program firefox --regex "http://[^ ]+"
map ctrl+shift+e        run_simple_kitten text url_hints

# Sending arbitrary text on shortcut key presses
# You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to
# the client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text
# This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.
# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
# to the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key):
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
# map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH

# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the
# specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special
# rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
# patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name
#
# For example:
#
# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols


# OS specific tweaks

# Copy to clipboard on select. With this enabled, simply selecting text with
# the mouse will cause the text to be copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms
# such as macOS/Wayland that do not have the concept of primary selections. Note
# that this is a security risk, as all programs, including websites open in your
# browser can read the contents of the clipboard.
copy_on_select no

# Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of "system"
# means to use the default system color, a value of "background" means to use
# the default background color and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such
# as #12af59 or "red".
macos_titlebar_color system

# Hide the kitty window's title bar on macOS.
macos_hide_titlebar no

# Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will use
# the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This will
# break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal programs, but you
# can use the macOS unicode input technique.
macos_option_as_alt yes

# The number is a percentage of maximum volume.
# See man XBell for details.
